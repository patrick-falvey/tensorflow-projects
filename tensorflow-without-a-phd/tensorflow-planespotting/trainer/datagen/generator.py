# Generates 20x20 background tiles from the 88 500x500 background tiles
# in sample_data/USGS_public_domain/tr* into output file backgrounds.pklz
# Default settings: 20x20px output tiles, 5px overlap between adjacent tiles
# 1.5x zoom out until source 500x500 tile is fully used, 45Â° rotations.
# Can generate as many as 711,000 tiles with these settings.
# To generate fewer tiles, use the skip setting. With skip=13, only one tile out of 13
# will be generated. No skipping with skip=1.
