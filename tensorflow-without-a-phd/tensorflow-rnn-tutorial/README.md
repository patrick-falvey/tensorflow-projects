# RNN Tutorial
This tutorial is a hands-on complement to the "Tensorflow, deep learning and Recurrent Neural Networks" talk ([video](https://youtu.be/fTUwdXUFfI8), [slides](https://goo.gl/UuN41S)). If you are looking for the "Shakespeare" model featured in the talk, you can find it here: [tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare](https://github.com/martin-gorner/tensorflow-rnn-shakespeare).

 
## Requirements

Install Python 3, then pip(3)-install jupyter, matplotlib and tensorflow.

On Windows, Anaconda is recommended.

## Tutorial

The tutorial is in the `/tutorial` folder

Instructions are in `*_playground.ipynb` files.

Solutions are in `*_solution.ipynb` files.

Notebooks execute locally. You can also run on Google Cloud ML Engine using the run-on-cloud-ml-engine.ipynb bash script.
